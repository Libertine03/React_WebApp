# Film editor
## This web application was created using HTML, CSS and React JS

It is a small web application that allows you to _view_, _edit_ and _add_ movies to a local server (in this case, the '**json-server**').

All components created in the application are located in the _src/components_ folder. The entire movie database is located in the _db.json_ file.

## Main page
On the main page, you can select a movie from the list and view all the information about it.
